Hello,
Thank you for purchasing Medieval Props. These objects were done by me over the recent years.

This is a graphical asset, no animations, so there is not much to tell about it. 
Please note that the scene&scripts are just there to show the assets. I am an artist, and not a programmer, so my solutions might be primitive in Unity. Use the scripts at your own risk; I do not support them.

If you have any problems or want to share your opinions, you can write to kalamona01@gmail.com.

Cheers,
Gergely Zsolnay
